# Kaggle

## Kaggle competitions

The repository contains Kaggle challenge competitions for Titantic survival predction, Housing sale price prediction,
and MNIST challenge. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks which illustrate EDA of each dataset, construction of a prediction model,
and the training process. Some projects use stacking/ensembling approaches and contain an **[project_name]** notebook and a seperate
**xgboost-[project_name]** notebook which generates first-round predictions and use XGBoost for final predictions. Also note that
some folders do not include datasets due to their size.
A colab repository for each project are also hosted on google drive. Please access these links to see a full example.
